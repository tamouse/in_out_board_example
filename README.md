# InOutBoard

Partial implementation of an In-Out-Board sort of thing.

Problem proposed by a user on IRC channel #ruby on Freenode.

Want to be able to find an available person at a given time based on
their office hours.

## Usage

It's just some models:

* User - name of user, and a collection of their office hours (shifts)
* Shift - day of the week, start and end times
* ShiftTime - hours and minutes, used to construct an actual time with
the shift

## Contributing

Take it, it's yours.
